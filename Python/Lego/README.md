## Lego Sets Dashboard (Python)

### **Overview** 
This project explores thousands of LEGO sets released between 1970 and 2022, analyzing trends, themes, and key insights using Python. The dataset was first cleaned and prepared using Pandas, ensuring accuracy and consistency. Visualizations were created with Matplotlib to highlight patterns and distributions in the data. This analysis falls under descriptive analytics, providing a historical perspective on LEGO’s evolution over the decades.
