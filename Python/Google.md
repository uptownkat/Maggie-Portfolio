Google Trends Analysis: Generative AI Interest by Country

In this exercise, I analyzed the global search interest of the topic "Generative AI" and identified the top 10 countries where the topic was most popular. The data was retrieved using Google Trends API (Pytrends) and pandas, mattplotlib libraries with result ranked by search volume, with values normalized from 0 to 100, where 100 represents the peak interest for the term. I then created several different charts to illustrate how to showcase this same data visually. 



#### Connect to Google API

- !pip install pytrends

#### Import Libraries

- import pandas as pd
- from pytrends.request import TrendReq
- import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
- trends = TrendReq()

Summary

These different charts showcase the variablity of interest across the top 10 countries that are searching "Generative AI" in Google over the past five years. 
The line card show the trend during the course of this time period, illustrating the most widely searched times and fluctuations. The Heat Map showcases the intensity by color. For further analysis, one can query locally within one of the countries to further see where the concentration of those searching lie.  Pie Chart displays the proportion visually of each country compared to others. 
These insights can help marketers, educators, and businesses understand where these two subjects are trending globally, allowing for targeted content strategies and localized outreach.
