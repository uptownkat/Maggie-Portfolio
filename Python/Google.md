### Google Trends Analysis: Generative AI Interest by Country

In this analysis, I examined the top-ranking countries with the highest interest in the topic "Generative AI" based on Google search trends over the past five years. The data was retrieved using the Google Trends API (Pytrends) and visualized with pandas, matplotlib, and seaborn.

Search interest is measured on a scale from 0 to 100, where 100 represents peak interest for the term. To illustrate global trends and rankings, I created four different visualizations.
