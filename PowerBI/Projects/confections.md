## Confections Sales Dashboard (Microsoft Power BI) 
### Overview  

This is a descriptive analysis of candy sales at retail in selected markets in Califonia during the period 2022. Based on the datasets,  I used Power BI to clean, transform, and model the datasets. By creating measures and custom columns using DAX calcuations, I identified insights on revenue and profits, trends, and performance on stores across different cities. I created an inteactive dashboard providing quick statistics for each visual searchable by Quarter.
