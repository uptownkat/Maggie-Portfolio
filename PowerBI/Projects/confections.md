## Confections Sales Dashboard (Microsoft Power BI) 
### Overview  

This is a descriptive analysis of candy sales at retail in selected markets in Califonia during the period 2022. Based on the datasets,  I used Power BI to clean, transform, and model the datasets. By creating measures and custom columns using DAX calcuations, I identified insights on revenue and profits, trends, and performance on stores across different cities. I created an inteactive dashboard providing quick statistics for each visual searchable by Quarter.

Seasonal trends may influence sales, as revenue fluctuates month-over-month.


Retail performance varies, with specialty candy stores contributing significantly alongside major retailers like Walmart, Target, and CVS.


Los Angeles, Fresno, and Pasadena are top-performing cities in terms of total profit.
