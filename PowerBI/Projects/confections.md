## Confections Sales Dashboard (Microsoft Power BI) 
### Overview  
In this analysis I built dashboards highlighting the scope of the sales of candy brands at retail in selected markets in California during the period in 2022. I used Power BI to clean, transform, and model the datasets. By creating measures and custom columns using DAX calcuations, I identified insights on revenue and profits, trends, and performance on stores across different cities.

### Datasets 
[Confections Datasets](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/maggieakarn/candy-sales-in-california/settings)
- **Sales** (OrderID, Sales Date, Category, Product, Quantity, StoreID)
- **Product** (ProductID, CategoryID, Cost, Price)
- **Store** (StoreID, StoreName, City)


### Key Insights
