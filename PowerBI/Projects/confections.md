## Confections Sales Dashboard (Microsoft Power BI) 
### Overview  

This project presents a descriptive analysis of candy sales at retail stores across selected markets in California during 2022. Using Power BI, I cleaned, transformed, and modeled the datasets to uncover key insights. By leveraging DAX calculations, including custom columns and measures, I analyzed revenue, profits, trends, and store performance across different cities. The final result is an interactive dashboard that provides quick, searchable statistics for each visual, allowing users to filter insights by quarter.

Seasonal trends may influence sales, as revenue fluctuates month-over-month.


Retail performance varies, with specialty candy stores contributing significantly alongside major retailers like Walmart, Target, and CVS.


Los Angeles, Fresno, and Pasadena are top-performing cities in terms of total profit.
