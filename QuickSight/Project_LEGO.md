## 🟥 Lego Dashboard – Descriptive Analysis  

Overview  
Using Amazon Quicksight, I create a LEGO interactive dashboard that explore thousands of sets released by the company from 1970 to 2022. I started with cleaning and preparing the data  
using Python (pandas). This project is a fruitful exercise of descriptive analysis using these tools.
