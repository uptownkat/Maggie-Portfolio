# Hospital Efficiency Project 

##     Overview  
This is a diagnostic analytics project where  I explored a various aspects of hospital data using SQL (mySQL). The datasets included patient admissions, physician performance and regional demographics. The goal of this project was to use SQL queries to extract valuable insights on the data which can be used to reveal insights to improve patient care and optimize hospital performance.  

###    Challenges

- How can hospital improve patient outcomes? 
- How can hospital allocate resources across different regions?
- How can hospital improve preparation for volume of admissions?
- How can hospital improve patient care?
 
‭  
###     Datasets

-  **patients** 
(patient_ID, first_name, last_name, gender, birth-date, city, province_id, allergies, height, weight) 
- **doctors** 
(doctor_id, first_name, last_name, specialty)
- **admissions** 
(patient_id, admission_date, discharge_date, diagnosis, attending_doctor_id)
- **province_names** 
(province-id, province_name)


###   Stakeholders

- **Internals** 
(Hospital Management, Medical Staff, Regional Managers)
- **Externals** 
(Patients, Health Authorities)


###   Analysis 
- Patient volume of treating physicians 
- Trends in admissions (demographic, geographic)
- Common Diagnosis treated by hospital network, physician
- Common Diagnosis suffered by patients, province
- Patient stay relationship to diagnosis, province, hospital
- Distribution of Paitent admission by age group, province


###     Project
