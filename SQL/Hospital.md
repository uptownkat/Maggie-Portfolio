# Hospital Efficiency Project

## Overview  
The hospital network is facing challenges in ensuring operational efficiency and patient
satisfaction. Specifically, you need to analyze the data to address the following questions:
How can we optimize resource allocation across different regions?
Which doctors are handling the highest number of cases, and how does this affect
patient outcomes?
Are there any trends in patient admissions based on demographics or geographic
location?
What are the common diagnoses, and how can the hospital better prepare for them?
How can we improve patient care by understanding the distribution of allergies and other
health conditions?
