## Maggie Rhee â€“ Data Analytics Portfolio  

Welcome to my data analytics portfolio. Here, I showcase my expertise in SQL, Python, Power BI, Tableau, and AWS QuickSight. This portfolio includes projects spanning different types of analytics, some of which I completed during my training with Syntax Technologies, while others were self-initiated. These projects highlight not only my technical skills but also my passion for exploring data, uncovering insights, and solving complex problems. I am especially driven by the power of data storytellingâ€”transforming raw information into impactful visualizations that inform and inspire.
